Broken brute-force protection, multiple credentials per request

Goal:
- Exploit logic flaw in the brute force protection mechanism and access Carlos's account.

Victim's username: carlos

Analysis:
---------

1. With Burp running, investigate the login page. Notice that the POST /login request submits the login
   credentials in JSON format. Send this request to Burp Repeater.

2. In Burp Repeater, replace the single string value of the password with an array of strings containing
   all of the candidate passwords. For example:
    "username" : "carlos",
    "password" : [
        "123456",
        "password",
        "qwerty"
        ...
    ]

3. Send the request. This will return a 302 response.

4. Right-click on this request and select Show response in browser. Copy the URL and load it in the browser.
   The page loads and you are logged in as carlos.

5. Click My account to access Carlos's account page and solve the lab.
