2FA broken logic

Goals:
- Exploit 2FA logic flaw to access Carlos's account.

Your credentials: wiener:peter
Victim's username: carlos

Analysis:
---------

1. With Burp running, log in to your own account and investigate the 2FA verification process. Notice that in the POST /login2 request,
   the verify parameter is used to determine which user's account is being accessed.

2. Log out of your account.
    
3. Send the GET /login2 request to Burp Repeater. Change the value of the verify parameter to carlos, delete the session token and send the request. This ensures
   that a temporary 2FA code is generated for Carlos.

   2 Vulnerabilities so far:
   -------------------------
   1. The app depends on client side parameters in order to perform authentication decisions.
   2. The session management is broken because we removed our session token and we are still
      able to get access to /login2 page.

4. Go to the login page and enter your username and password. Then, submit an invalid 2FA code.

    1 more Vulnerability:
    ---------------------
    If we send the request five times, we can see that there is not a brute force protection mechanism.

5. Send the POST /login2 request to Burp Intruder.

6. In Burp Intruder, set the verify parameter to carlos and add a payload position to the mfa-code parameter. Brute-force the verification code.

7. Load the 302 response in the browser.
