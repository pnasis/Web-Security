Username enumeration via account lock

Goals
- Exploit logic flaw to enumerate valid username and then brute-force user's password.

Analysis:
---------

1. Send a request with random credentials. Then send it to Repeater.

2. Try sending multiple requests in order to identify if a lockout mechanism exists.
   Send the request to Intruder.

3. Mark as payload the username and the password field values (password should be
   marked as test$$). Then select the Attack type to be Cluster bomb. For the first
   payload select the usernames.txt list and for the second Null payloads. On the
   payload settings, select 5 payloads to be generated. Then press Start Attack.

4. We can see that if we try many times to login with an invalid username, we will
   not trigger a lockout mechanism, but if we try with a valid one, we will get
   banned. So we can enumerate a valid username.

5. Then we can try to brute force the password for the valid username.

6. In the results, look at the grep extract column. Notice that there are a couple
   of different error messages, but one of the responses did not contain any error
   message. Make a note of this password.

7. Try to log in using the identified username and password.
