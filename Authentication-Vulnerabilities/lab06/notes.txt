Broken brute-force protection, IP block

Goals
- Brute force the victim's password

Your credentials: wiener:peter
Victim's username: carlos

Analysis:
---------

1. Send a request with carlos username and a random password. Then send the
   request to Repeater and send it a few times.

2. First we can observe that there is a username enumeration vulnerability due to
   the message "Incorrect password". Second, in the third attempt we will see that
   we get an IP ban for 1 minute.

3. If we try immediately to login with your credentials you will not be able due to
   the ban. If you try in one minute with your account you will log in successfully.

4. Then try to send 2 requests with wrong credentials, one with your cerdentials,
   and then one more with wrong credentials. If you don't get a ban, then it means
   that a vulnerability is presented.

5. Run the python script in order to generate the desired lists for the attack.

6. Send the request to Intruder. Add as payloads the username and the password values
   and select as Attack type Pitchfork. Then select as payloads the generated lists.
   You must also select from the Resource pool the maximum number of concurrent
   requests to be 1. Then press Start attack.

7. Search for a request with username carlos and status code 302.

8. Login with the acquired credentials.
