Username enumeration via subtly different responses

Goals
- Enumerate a valid username and then brute-force the user's password.

Analysis:
---------

1. Send a login request with invalid username and password

2. Send this request to burp Intruder

3. Mark the username field, on the payloads select the username list and then press
   Start attack

4. First check if there is a different Status code

5. Then compare some requests that have a different Length

6. If there is nothing different, then Filter with "Invalid username or password."
   and make a negative search to see if a response is different. Be creative!

7. A request is slightly different. It preserves the message "Invalid username or
   password". This means that the username akamai is correct.

8. Try to bruteforce using hydra by running this command:
   sudo hydra -l akamai -P /home/kali/Identification-and-Authentication-Failures/lab04/passwords.txt -u -f -I "0ad000a104e6bfe486303c7800f60081.web-security-academy.net" https-post-form "/login:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^&Login=Login:Log In" -V -o results.txt

9. Log in with the user's credentials

username -> akamai
password -> zxcvbnm
