File path traversal, validation of file extension with null byte bypass

Goal:
- Retrieve the contents of the /etc/passwd file.

Analysis:
---------

1. Use Burp Suite to intercept and modify a request that fetches a product image.

2. Modify the filename parameter, giving it the value './../../etc/passwd%00.png'

3. Observe that the response contains the contents of the /etc/passwd file.
