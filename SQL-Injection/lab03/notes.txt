SQL Injection in the product category filter

Goals: determine the number of columns that are being
returned by the query by performing a SQL injection UNION
attack that returns an additional row containig null
values.

Background (Union):

table1      table2
a | b       c | d
-----       -----
1 , 2       2 , 3
3 , 4       4 , 5

Query #1: select a,b from table1
1,2
3,4

Query #2: select a,b from table1 UNION select c,d from table2
1,2
3,4
2,3
4,5

Scenario: select a,b from table1 UNION select username, password from users

Rule:
- The number and the order of the columns must be the same in all queries
- The data types must be compatible

SQLi attack (way #1):

select ? from table1 UNION select NULL
-error -> incorrect number of columns

select ? from table1 UNION select NULL, NULL, NULL
-200 response code -> correct number of columns

SQLI attack (way #2):

select a, b from table1 order by 3
