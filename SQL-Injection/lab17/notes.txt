SQL injection with filter bypass via XML encoding

Goal:
- Exploit SQL injection to retrieve the admin user's credentials from the users table and log into their account.

/* Different formats may provide different ways for you to obfuscate attacks that are otherwise blocked due to WAFs and other defense mechanisms.
Weak implementations often look for common SQL injection keywords within the request, so you may be able to bypass these filters by encoding or
escaping characters in the prohibited keywords. */

Analysis:
---------
/* A web application firewall (WAF) will block requests that contain obvious signs of
a SQL injection attack. You'll need to find a way to obfuscate your malicious query
to bypass this filter. We recommend using the Hackvertor extension to do this. */

1. We try to send a request from the Repeater by altering the storeId
   by adding UNION SELECT NULL. This will give a 403 Forbidden response with a text
   saying "Attack detected". So we will try to obfuscate the payload. Select the payload
   and then RightClick->Extentions->Hackvector->Encode->hex_entities. If we send again
   the request we will get a 200 OK response. So the injection was successful.

2. If we try INION SELECT NULL, NULL we will get as a result 0 units which means that
   there is one column on the query. So we are not able to output the result in one
   column. We will use concatenation.

3. 1 UNION SELECT username || '~' || password  FROM users
