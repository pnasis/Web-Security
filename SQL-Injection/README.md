# SQLi

SQL Injection (SQLi) attack is a cyberattack that injects malicious SQL code into an application, allowing the attacker to view or modify a database. According to the Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP), injection attacks, which include SQL injections, were the third most serious web application security risk in 2021.

## About

This repo was created while I was attending the course **"Mastering SQL Injection - The Ultimate Hands-On Course"** from Udemy. The labs were from the **PortSwigger** platform. It contains automated scripts that try to exploit different types of SQL Injection.
 

## Tools
I used **Kali Linux** which is an open-source, Debian-based Linux distribution aimed at advanced Penetration Testing as my OS. I also used **BurpSuite** which is a class-leading vulnerability scanning, penetration testing, and web app security platform. Lastly, I utilize **FoxyProxy** in order to use BurpSuite's proxy for intercepting the requests.
